## High-priority bugs:
* Loading 8888.xml does not properly load the combo box value of the groove options
* Changing the row does not change the groove options box to the persistent data

## New Features
* Implementing the reporter that is supposed to show the contour lines
* Check if the same problem with the groove options box exists as with input profile
* Use the Github actions strategy/matrix setting to create Linux release (but maybe find out what exactly is needed before)

## Lower priority:
* Fix CI/CD to generate changelog
* Test CI/CD locally using act
