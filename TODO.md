## High-priority bugs:

## New Features
* Properly add all required parameters

## Lower priority:
* Use the Github actions strategy/matrix setting to create Linux release (but maybe find out what exactly is needed before)
* Maybe add a padding around the PyQT forms
* Question: Do we actually need to save the current row or is it enough to always simply call the function

## General things
* Testing
