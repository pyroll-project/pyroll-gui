## High-priority bugs:
* Loading 8888.xml does not properly load the combo box value of the groove options
* Fix the deletion causing 'list index out of range' errors

## New Features
* Question: Do we actually need to save the current row or is it enough to always simply call the function
* Adding shortcuts to delete and add new rows
* Implementing the reporter that is supposed to show the contour lines
* Should the input profile be plotted as well?

## Lower priority:
* Find out how the groove should really be printed
* Pretty up the groove option parameters
* Fix CI/CD to generate changelog
* Test CI/CD locally using act
* Use the Github actions strategy/matrix setting to create Linux release (but maybe find out what exactly is needed before)
* Maybe add a padding around the PyQT forms

## General things
* Testing
